## Hi, I'm Anna ðŸ‘‹

I recently defended my Ph.D. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. My work focused on molecular modelling of polymer nanocomposites. 

I'm currently on the job market! I'm excited about the potential of integrating AI and physics-based molecular models to solve challenges in biological and chemical systems.
